# Natural Language Processing - course control panel

This is the **`.github` repo** for the `hertie-nlp-e1282` course org - the primary control panel faculty & instructors use
to run and configure the course.

## Run an action

Open the **[Actions tab](https://github.com/hertie-nlp-e1282/.github/actions)**, pick a workflow, and click **Run workflow**. Workflows only show if you have write access - i.e. you're either (1) in this org's `course-admin` team (declared here, course-wide), or (2) in a cohort's `instructors-<tag>` team (declared in that cohort's own `classroom-config/people.yml` then back-propagated). The full, annotated list of actions is on the **[org home page](https://github.com/hertie-nlp-e1282)**.

## Typical flow

1. **New materials repo** / **New assignment** - scaffold your content repos, then fill them in.
2. Create an empty **cohort org** for the year, add the bot as an Owner, then run **Bootstrap cohort**.
3. Each session: **Release materials** / **Release assignment** - or pre-schedule them in `schedule.yml` (recommended).
4. Grading: **Grade assignment** -> **Sync gradebooks** -> **Render grades** -> **Distribute grades**.
